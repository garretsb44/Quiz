Quiz Game

Description:

I have created an application that allows the user to answer a five question quiz. Each time the user takes the quiz, their high-score is tallied and added to a high-score page.The application will help users gain better understanding of some front-end definitions.  This application helped me as a developer understand javascript better. 

Installation:

The site can be accessed through https://garretsb44.github.io/Quiz/

Usage:

Take th quiz to see how well you know general front-end definitions
